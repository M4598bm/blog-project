Description:

This is a simple travel blog. Each user has their own feed where all their previous posts live, and where they can add new posts. Users can visit another user's feed and like or comment each post. Each user also has a small bio under their profile picture that appears at the side of their blog posts.

How to use:

If you are not already a member, you must first register for an account. Once a user logs in, he/she will be taken to their homepage. Here they can write new a post or delete an old one. At the top of the page there is a navigation bar that will allow users to go to a settings page or find the blogs of other users. In the settings page they can change their password and their biographical information, as well as their prfile picture. To visit another user's blog page, simply click on their username. It will take you directly to their blog feed, where you can comment or like their posts.
